# Voightware website 

Landing page for Voightware with some additional about text and ways to support Voightware. It uses the static site generator [Eleventy (11ty)][11ty] and fetches the GitHub stats for the projects using the [GitHub Api](https://docs.github.com/en/rest). The design and lay-out of this page were heavily inspired by the [CSS CLI](https://stylestage.dev/styles/css-cli/) style by Ryan Mulligan on stylestage.dev.
